## 🛡️ Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning & FastAPI
📌 Overview

Phishing websites are a major cybersecurity threat used to steal sensitive information such as credentials and financial data.

This project builds and deploys a machine learning–based phishing detection system using URL-based features and exposes it as a REST API using FastAPI.

The focus of this project is not only on model accuracy, but also on real-world deployment, inference logic, and robustness.
📊 Dataset

    Source: Kaggle – Web Page Phishing Dataset

    Target Variable:

        1 → Phishing

        0 → Legitimate

🔍 Features Used (19)

The model uses engineered URL-based features, including:

    URL length

    Number of dots, hyphens, slashes

    Presence of special characters (@, ?, =, %, $, etc.)

    Redirection indicators

These features capture common structural patterns found in phishing URLs.
🧠 Machine Learning Models

Two models were trained and evaluated:

    Decision Tree Classifier (baseline)

    Random Forest Classifier (final model)

📈 Model Evaluation

    Train–test split used for validation

    Metrics analyzed:

        Accuracy

        Confusion Matrix

        Class-wise performance

📝 Observations

    Random Forest outperformed the baseline model

    Class imbalance required careful evaluation

    Some low-risk synthetic inputs were misclassified due to dataset distribution

    This was mitigated using probability-based inference instead of hard predictions

⚙️ Inference Logic

Instead of relying solely on class labels:

    The model uses predict_proba

    A probability threshold of 0.6 is applied

📌 Decision Rule

    Probability ≥ 0.6 → Phishing

    Probability < 0.6 → Legitimate

This approach reduces false positives, a critical requirement in cybersecurity systems.
🚀 API Deployment (FastAPI)

The trained model is deployed as a RESTful service using FastAPI.

    Note:
    The trained model file (phishing_model.pkl) is not included in the repository due to size limitations.
    It can be generated by running the model training notebook.

🧠 Key Learnings

    Importance of matching training and deployment environments

    Handling model serialization compatibility issues

    Designing production-style ML APIs

    Using probability thresholds instead of raw predictions

    Understanding real-world data vs synthetic assumptions

🔮 Future Improvements

    Add Docker support for containerized deployment

    Log predictions and analyze patterns using SIEM tools (e.g., Splunk)

    Feature importance visualization

    Integration with browser extensions or security tools

    Online learning or periodic model retraining

🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the end-to-end lifecycle of an AI-powered cybersecurity system — from data and modeling to deployment and monitoring.

It emphasizes practical AI engineering decisions rather than just model performance.
